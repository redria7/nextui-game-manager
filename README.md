## How do I setup Game Manager?

1. Own a TrimUI Brick and have a SD Card with NextUI configured.
2. Connect your Brick to a Wi-Fi network. (This is need for Art Work Download Support)
3. Download the latest Game Manager release from this repo.
4. Unzip the release download.
5. With your Brick powered off, eject the SD Card and connect it to your computer.
6. Copy the entire Game Manager.pak file to `SD_ROOT/Tools/tg5040`.
7. Reinsert your SD Card into your Brick.
8. Launch `Game Manager` from the `Tools` menu and enjoy!

## 🌸 Flower Giving Time! 🌸

Like with my other Pak [Mortar](https://github.com/UncleJunVIP/Mortar.pak), I want to also
shoutout [@josegonzalez](https://github.com/josegonzalez) for their
awesome [minui-list](https://github.com/josegonzalez/minui-list), [miniui-presenter](https://github.com/josegonzalez/minui-presenter)
and [minui-keyboard](https://github.com/josegonzalez/minui-keyboard) projects.

Without these phenomenal pieces of software I likely would not have built Mortar.
